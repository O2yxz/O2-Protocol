#Liquidity protocol
Put any ERC-721 token up for collateralization. Other users can now offer you a loan.

If you accept a loan, the ERC20 gets paid out from the lenders account to you, and your NFT gets locked in the O2 smart contract.

Once you repay the loan the asset will be transfered back to you. If you donâ€™t pay back the total repayment amount before the due date, the asset will be transferred to the lender.
Borrowing in O2 Token will consent higher date to return
